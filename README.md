# Run Sense
This application consists of an iOS application paired with Arduino hardware to analyze a user's stride while running. This data is then pushed to the cloud to be stored and can later be reviewed from a web client. The goal of the application is to monitor a user's stride while they run and determine if they are heel-striking, pronating, or supinating. The user can then try to correct their gait so that they avoid injury. All initial parts of this project were developed in 24 hours at HackDFW hackathon.
